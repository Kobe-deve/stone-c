# stone-c
A turn based rpg programmed in C

A small project I developed from January 7th 2019 to April 30th 2019. Stone Crawler was a passion project
that took me planning and researching gameplay systems and programming them out in C.

The program has multiple systems:
-The battle system
-The dungeon crawling system
-The file saving system
-The player storage system

Each system has required different means of executing them such as the player information storage system involving the connection between the dungeon crawling and battle system with the player stats and what weapons they are able to create in the game and having said information saved to a file to be accessed to at any other time.
